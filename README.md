# Invisible_cloak

So here we have made cool project using openCv ,i:e, Invisible cloak inspired from Harry Potter :).

The idea is to first take the background photo and save it as img.jpg ,then using result.py file we capture video using openCv.
Then the video is overlayed on that image and (in our case we have selected red color ) ,the selected color (should be same as blanket color) pixels are removed from the image and it shows background image in it.
Thus creating illusion that we can see through the blanket. 


The rgb color scheme have been converted to hsv color(HSV  Hue , Saturation , lightness).

Libraries used: openCv , numpy , PILLOW

Steps:-

1. Run invisible_cloak.py file to generate a background image
2. Now run result.py 

Thank You.
